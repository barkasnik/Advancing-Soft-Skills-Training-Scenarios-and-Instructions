## Instructions for Users on Customising Scenarios 

1. **Change Intensity**  
   - *Increase Intensity*: Make the AI character more emotional, aggressive, or resistant. Use stronger language and more frequent interruptions.  
   - *Decrease Intensity*: Make the AI character more open, less defensive, and quicker to accept explanations or compromise.

2. **Reverse Roles**  
   - Swap the AI and user roles (e.g., have the AI play the manager and the user play the challenging employee).
   - Adjust aims and challenges accordingly (e.g., manager defends policy, employee pushes back).

3. **Alter Power Dynamics**  
   - Change the seniority of the roles (e.g., peer-to-peer, junior challenging senior).
   - Adjust the context to reflect the new hierarchy.

4. **Modify the Context**  
   - Change the setting (e.g., remote vs. in-person, private vs. public discussion).
   - Add time pressure or external scrutiny (e.g., media attention, regulatory deadlines).

5. **Vary the Outcome Stakes**  
   - Make the consequences more severe (e.g., risk of dismissal, public scandal).
   - Lower the stakes for a more developmental conversation (e.g., informal feedback, minor process changes).

6. **Adjust the Evidence**  
   - Provide more or less evidence for the manager/user to use.
   - Introduce ambiguity or conflicting accounts to increase complexity.

7. **Add a Third Party**  
   - Introduce a witness, mediator, or observer to change the dynamic.
   - Have the AI or user refer to support from others.

*Example:*  
- Original: HEO resists new policy, G7 explains rationale.  
- Altered: G7 resists new policy, HEO (user) must persuade upwards, with added time pressure.
